Nested sampling represents the state-of-the-art in direct numerical integration in high dimensions. By removing geometry from the computation of volumes (instead estimating volumes probabilistically), it enables the numerical calculation of integrals such as the Bayesian evidence in arbitrarily high dimensions. However, this probabilistic element incurs a substantial (albeit controllable) error bar on the results of these computations. This error in the evidence is typically of order unity and proportional to $n_\mathrm{live}^{-1/2}$. Whilst the error can therefore be made arbitrarily small by increasing the number of live points, this also increases the computational cost. It is therefore prudent to consider if there are ways in which to reduce the proportionality constant.

The orthodox nested sampling algorithm does not make any assumptions regarding the smoothness of the likelihood function.\footnote{In fact, the nested sampling algorithm is invariant under monotonic transformations of the likelihood.} The prior volumes at each iteration of nested sampling follow a particular distribution where one can randomly generate $t_i$ according to a power law distribution $P(t_i)= N t_i^{N-1}$ to get the prior volume, $X_{i}=t_iX_{i-1}$. One could use the same set of simulated $X$s to calculate the evidence for any general likelihood function given the same numbers of dead and live points. 

It is clear that the accumulated prior mass, $X(L)$ is solely a function of the likelihood. Thus, the increments at each iteration, $i$, can be guided by how much the likelihood varies at each iteration. There is undoubtedly some information to be extracted, based on how much the likelihood increases at each iteration, to inform our choice of prior volume estimates. This of course, uses the continuity and smoothness of the likelihoods in question. Continuity and smoothness are fair assumptions, given the model is physical and the number of live points is sufficient. It makes intuitive sense that we would fare better utilising the information encoded within the likelihood manifold that we are exploring, rather than taking steps entirely in the dark, guided through pure probability.

\label{fig:skil1}
\end{figure}

Now let us try to gain an intuition by visually examining a nested sampling run in terms of its approximation of prior volumes. Let us first look at what an analytical plot of the likelihood as a function of prior volume may look like in \cref{fig:skil1} for some example likelihood.

\begin{figure} 
\centering    
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/Raster/Screenshot 2022-11-08 at 06.33.03.png}
\caption{ Orthodox nested sampling and ideal gradient nested sampling simulations of the likelihoods plotted against prior volumes. These are nested sampling runs for the same example likelihood function as in \cref{fig:skil1}. The lower plot shows what we hope to get from gradient nested sampling based on the fundamental idea of utilising a `prior on curves'. The numbers above the points denote the ordering of their respective likelihood magnitudes; for example, the point labelled by $50$ would have a likelihood which is higher than the $49$ previous poiÂ§nts. The likelihood values of each respective point are known with zero associated error. Thus, the two plots only differ in terms of the $\log X$ locations of points--meaning that each point's respective likelihood is the same for both methods. The gradient nested sampling points have varying gaps in the x-axis meanwhile the orthodox nested sampling has constant gaps. This is because the orthodox method assumes a constant shrinkage of the prior volume regardless of the change in likelihood at each new sample, however gradient nested sampling uses this likelihood change as a guide to approximate the prior volume shrinkage. The reader should keep in mind that nested sampling calculates the Bayesian evidence through a sum containing prior volumes and their respective likelihoods. Thus, if we reduce the errors on the prior volume estimates, we reduce the carried error on the results of nested sampling. Altered from \cite{10.1214/06-BA127}.}
\label{fig:skil2}
\end{figure}

Let us now examine, for this example likelihood in \cref{fig:skil1}, the `orthodox nested sampling' results for the prior volumes estimates in comparison with the ideal gradient nested sampling prior volume estimates. Refer to \cref{fig:skil2} for a visualisation of this. The reader should keep in mind that in nested sampling the set of sampled likelihoods have no error associated with them. This means that the $y$-axes coordinates in the plots in \cref{fig:skil2} have no error associated with them and that the entirety of the error comes from the prior volumes, represented by the x-axes. Note that the points in the gradient nested sampling case in the figure more closely follow the true shape, as shown in \cref{fig:skil1}, of the likelihood function. This is because the error on the prior volumes is reduced in gradient nested sampling due to the usage of the information encoded within the gradient of the likelihood. The creator of nested sampling, John Skilling, was adamant that a `prior on curves' must exist but we just need to find it~\cite{paris2022}. Since gradient nested sampling allows us to more accurately simulate the prior volumes for known log-likelihood values, this results in a more accurate nested sampling run and thus more accurate Bayesian evidence calculations. Now that we have covered the motivation and general intuition behind gradient nested sampling, we can get into a rigorous derivation in the next section.




\section{\label{sec:level2}Theory}\label{sec:theorygrad}

The theoretical underpinning for gradient nested sampling is rooted in using the smoothness and continuity of the likelihood function to make a better estimate of the prior volume at each iteration. A priori this should be better than a completely random guess of prior volume that does not use any of the useful information encoded within the gradient of the likelihood being sampled. Current methods of determining prior volume return a set of $X_i$ that may well be used against any other likelihood to generate an evidence\footnote{As previously stated, the orthodox nested sampling algorithm is invariant under monotonic transformations of the likelihood function.} (given the same choice of dead and alive points of course). 

To begin with the gradient nested sampling derivation, we must examine a set of $k$ consecutive points in ${X_i}$ where the gradient,
\begin{equation}
g= \frac{d \log X}{d \log L},
\label{eq:ggg}
\end{equation}
%
is approximately constant. Using the equations 
%
\begin{align}
g \delta \log L_{i} = \delta \log X_i= -\log t_i, \\
P(\log t_{i})=Ne^{N \log t_i},
\label{eq:glogt}
\end{align}
%
where $N$ is the number of `live points'. We thus find
%
\begin{align}
P(\delta \log L_i|g)= gNe^{Ng \delta \log L_i},
\end{align}
%
where we substituted  $\log t_i= g\delta \log L_i$ and used 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \log t_i}{d\delta \log L_i}= g.
\end{equation}
For a given set of likelihood values $D= \{ \delta \log L_{i+1-(k/2)},\delta \log L_{i+2-(k/2)},...,\delta \log L_{i+(k/2)} \}$, which span $k$ consecutive points chosen in a deliberately symmetrical fashion around $i$, we have
%
\begin{align}
P(D|g)&= \prod_{j=i+1-(k/2)}^{i+(k/2)} P(\delta \log L_j|g) = \prod_{j=i+1-(k/2)}^{i+(k/2)} gN \exp (Ng \delta \log L_j).\\
&=  (gN)^k\exp\left(Ng \sum_{j=i+1-(k/2)}^{i+(k/2)}\delta \log L_j\right).\\
&=  (gN)^k\exp\left(Ng (\log L_{i-k/2} - \log L_{i-k/2})\right).
\end{align}
%
We find that $\log t_i$ follows a gamma distribution \cite{hogg_craig_1971} of the form:
%
\begin{equation}
P(\log t_i) \propto \frac{N^k}{\delta \log L_i}(\log t_i)^{k-1} \exp \left( \log t_i \frac{N(\log L_{i+k/2}-\log L_{i-k/2})}{\log L_i-\log L_{i-1}} \right).
\label{eq:blab}
\end{equation}
%
This is the main result of gradient nested sampling. \footnote{From this derivation we learn that we may use a function to draw samples from a gamma distribution, in our code to simulate our $\log t_i$ values for gradient nested sampling.} Note that for this step we used used Bayes' theorem with prior $\pi (g)=1/g$ to flip the conditional from $g$ to $D$. One must keep in mind that one could use other priors, $\pi(g)$, in this derivation. However our results, explored later in this chapter, that it might be the ideal prior given accurate information on the gradient of the likelihood and at the very least is superior to all other priors we tested. So as to not break the flow of this derivation we shall cover the different priors in more detail later in \cref{sec:exploring}. This step also used
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dg}{d\log t_i}  = 1/(\delta \log L_{i}),
\end{equation}
%
which is derived from \cref{eq:glogt} using that $\delta \log L_{i}$ is known and a constant. 

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/Raster/regeneratedfig2_3.pdf}
\caption{ Plots showing the accuracy of gradient nested sampling over varying $k$-values. The $y$-axis represents the $\log Z$ value averaged over 100 different sets of $\log X$ simulations. That is, each point plotted is the average over 100 different nested sampling runs with the same set of $\log L$ samples but each with its own simulated $\log X$ set. Several different variations of gradient nested sampling are plotted and have been elaborated upon in the text.}
\label{fig:loglolol}
\end{figure}

Now that we have understood how to reach the main result, \cref{eq:blab}, it can further be used to give us the expectation value and standard deviation:
%
\begin{equation}
  E(\log t_i)=  \frac{k(\log L_i-\log L_{i-1})}{N(\log L_{i+k/2}-\log L_{i-k/2})}, 
\label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
  \sigma(\log t_i)=  \frac{\sqrt{k}(\log L_i-\log L_{i-1})}{N(\log L_{i+k/2}-\log L_{i-k/2})}.  
\label{eq:err}
\end{equation}
%
This result is very suggestive. Orthodox nested sampling produces an error of 
%
\begin{equation}
    \sigma(\log t_i)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}
\end{equation}
%
since it estimates the prior volumes using the less accurate power law distribution. However, from \cref{eq:err} we find that for gradient nested sampling we have
%
\begin{equation}
  \sigma(\log t_i) \sim O(\frac{1}{ \sqrt{Nk}}). 
\label{eq:gamm}
\end{equation}
%
This gamma distribution error is a factor of $\sqrt{k}$ smaller than the power law error in orthodox nested sampling. This means that the resulting prior volume values will be more accurate for gradient nested sampling using the proposed gamma distribution. Thus, theoretically, resulting in more accurate posterior samples and evidence calculated from gradient nested sampling as compared to orthodox nested sampling. 
The way we arrive at the result in \cref{eq:gamm} is noting that if as we assumed in our derivation above the gradient is constant over the $k$ points that span our data set, $D$, then the fraction from \cref{eq:err} above
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{(\log L_i-\log L_{i-1})}{(\log L_{i+k/2}-\log L_{i-k/2})}   \propto \frac{1}{k}. 
\end{equation}
%
This is because the distance between each of the $k$ points on the $\log L$ vs $\log X$ graphs should be the same if the gradient is constant and the numerator is the vertical-axis distance between two points that are 1 iteration away from each other and the denominator is the vertical-axis distance between two points that are $k$ iterations away from each other.




\section{Exploring Different data sets $D$ and Priors}\label{sec:exploring}
An astute reader may have noticed a subtlety in the derivation: the initial and final $k/2$ `dead points' are orphan terms for which we would not be able to follow this same process of gradient nested sampling. The reason being that the above derivation assumes there exist $k/2$ points before and after the point we are trying to simulate using the gamma distribution. However, to avoid this issue, the first and last $k/2$ points can be assumed to follow the usual power law distribution. We can do this because $k$ is a small number in comparison with the total dead points and thus the change in total posterior mass in the final calculation would be negligible. 

Another subtlety is that this result assumes that $k$ is even. This is, however, not necessary and the breaking of generality stems from how we chose the set of consecutive points $D= \{ \delta \log L_{i+1-(k/2)},\delta \log L_{i+2-(k/2)},...,\delta \log L_{i+(k/2)} \}$. The reason for the symmetrical nature of these points about $i$ is that the crux of the calculation is trying to find the average of the gradient for our log-likelihood over the $k$ points in $D$. Then, we use this estimated average gradient to approximate how much our $\log X$ should have changed given that we have a known change in $\log L$. It is analogous to the case of a two dimensional curve, $y=f(x)$, for which we approximate the gradient by drawing a tangent and using the known change in the $y$-coordinate, we guess the change in $x$-coordinate. Given this information in the example, we accordingly use it to guide our estimate of the corresponding change in the horizontal axis coordinate. Thus, for defining $D$ we would like to use a string of points that best approximate the gradient at point $i$. Intuitively, this would be best performed through a set of points chosen symmetrically about $i$. There are different ways to select sets of points symmetrically about $i$ even allowing for odd $k$. However, that would make the derivation in \cref{sec:level2} more difficult to follow. The way it has been laid out in this derivation is how it is easily digested while still being symmetrical. This is since that the final result has that the $k$ we used to label our data points in $D$ is exactly the same as the $k$ in the resulting gamma distribution, $\Gamma (k,\theta)$, that is followed by the $\log t_i$. For completeness we define the gamma distribution: if a random variable follows the gamma distribution $X \sim \Gamma (k,\theta)$ then we have the probability density function for $X= x$ as:
%
\begin{equation}
    f(x;k,\theta) = \frac{x^{k-1} \exp (-x/\theta)}{\theta^k \Gamma(k)}, 
\end{equation}
%
where $\Gamma(k)$ is the gamma function evaluated at $k$.

Our particular choice of the prior, $\pi (g)=1/g$, also leads to this compact result mentioned in the line above. Though we initially made these choices for aesthetic reasons and neatness, it turns out that no other prior that we test gives as accurate results as this one.  In terms of the final results, changing the prior only changes the $k$ parameter that we input in the gamma distribution, $\Gamma ($k$,\theta)$, that generates the prior volumes. To avoid ambiguity, for now let us write the first parameter in the gamma distribution as an upper case $K$, $\Gamma ($K$,\theta)$. Using this terminology, our previous derivation arrived at $K=k$. However, if we used the one of the following priors, $\pi (g)$, instead: $\pi (g)=1$, $\pi (g)=1/g^2$, $\pi (g)=g$, we would get $K=k+1$, $K=k-1$, and $K=k+2$ correspondingly. We plot analyses of these other priors in \cref{fig:loglolol}. We shall also find that small shifts in the sequence of our $k$ points or changes from odd $k$ to even $k$ make immeasurable difference. In this chapter, we explore all plausible options to a realistic level. This includes the most symmetrical  with $2k+1$ points in $D$, with $k$ points ahead and behind $i$--this is plotted in \cref{fig:loglolol} as well.



\section{Results and Data} \label{sec:resdat}

\subsection{Initial Results}

Let us start by plotting the prior volumes themselves, as generated from the gamma distribution under our newly proposed gradient nested sampling scheme. It must be emphasised that for any one particular figure in this section we shall only use one set of $\log L$ samples, to generate different full sets of corresponding $\log X$s. A nested sampling run requires a set of sampled $\log L$ and a correspondingly generated set of $\log X$. Since the prior volumes are generated probabilistically, one set of sampled log-likelihoods can be used to generate many sets of $\log X$s. This is due to the computational restrictions regarding generation of a set of likelihood samples from large data sets for a nested sampling run. For example, the Gaia Data Release 2 is comprised of $340$ billion measurements of celestial sources~\cite{gaia_in_the_uk}. Generating just one set of $\log L$s for nested sampling takes weeks of compute time in the context of cosmology. So, one can always assume throughout this chapter that all separate sets of $\log X$s in the multiple nested sampling runs within a singular figure correspond to just one set of $\log L$s. 

Throughout our results in this chapter we shall use a toy model log-likelihood taken from ref \cite{10.1214/06-BA127}. This allows us to have precise and analytical values for $\log L$, $\log X$ and $\log Z$ to compare to the results of our proposed method. The toy model log-likelihood is

\begin{equation}
    \log L(\log X) = -\frac{\exp (\frac{2\log X}{C}) }{2 \sigma^2},
\label{eq:toy}
\end{equation}
%
with a flat prior 
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{prior}(\theta) = \frac{(C/2)!}{\pi^{C/2}}
\end{equation}
%
and log evidence being 
%
\begin{equation}
   \log Z = \log( (C/2)!) + \frac{C}{2}\log ((2\sigma^2)).
\end{equation}
%
Note that we denoted the prior by $\mathrm{prior}(\theta)$, so as to not have it confused with the prior on the gradient, $\pi(g)$. Also the fact that the right-hand side does not depend on the parameters, $\theta$, is due to it being constant for all parameter values--the definition of a flat prior.We take $C=10$ and $\sigma = 0.01$ for all the following results.

Now we have a picture of the likelihood and the prior that we shall use to run tests for gradient nested sampling. So let us then plot the preliminary results of the prior volumes as generated by the gradient nested sampling scheme in \cref{fig:logX1}.
%

\caption{ The plots of the toy model log-likelihood from \cref{eq:toy}, and its derivative (this is the inverse of $g$ from \cref{sec:theorygrad}), as a function of log X. The plot also demonstrates that in the direction of increasing iteration number, $i$, of the nested sampling algorithm the $\log X$ value decreases. This is knowledge is pertinent in understanding the subtleties of the algorithm.}
\label{fig:expo}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure} 
\centering    
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Chap2_fig1}
\caption{This figure contains 10 simulated sets of $\log X$s plotted for each simulation method. Each separate line represents a separate $\log X$ simulation which could be used for a separate nested sampling run. Again, all $50$ $\log X$ sets in this figure correspond to the same singular set of log-likelihood samples. The number of live points used was $1000$, and the number of dead points by the end was $100,000$. The $y$-axis represents how far the $\log X$ simulation has deviated from the `real' $\log X$ that has been calculated analytically. The black horizontal line corresponds to the ideal $\log X$ run. The orange lines labelled `power law distributed' refers to the usual method for simulating $\log X$s. The other lines are generated, using the method we describe in the text, with varying $k$ parameter values.}
\label{fig:logX1}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:logX1} visualises multiple sets of simulated prior volumes for multiple nested sampling runs and how they scatter from the true prior volume. It shows how gradient nested sampling reduces the errors on the prior volume simulations as compared to orthodox nested sampling. The closer a simulated $\log X$ set is to the true $\log X$ set in \cref{fig:logX1}, the lesser it would deviate from the zero. Thus, since the power-law lines scatter furthest from the centre line, they seem to have the least precision. Examine the brown lines, where we used our proposed gamma distribution method to generate the $\log X$s with $k$ equal to the number of live points. These brown lines have the largest precision but least accuracy--meaning if one averages all the brown $\log X$s, it would average to a completely biased answer. Increasing the $k$ parameter results in a trade-off between accuracy vs precision. When we increase the precision by increasing the $k$ value, it is a trade-off with accuracy. If the $k$-value is too high, the `estimated' gradient (from \cref{eq:est}) starts to become smaller than the actual gradient. This is because of the exponential relation between $\log L$ and $\log X$. It is such that, as the number of iterations of nested sampling increases the gradient decreases. This is visualised in \cref{fig:expo}, the gradient of $\log L$ vs $\log X$ decreases as the iterations of nested sampling increase--one must keep in mind that $\log X$ becomes more negative as the iterations increase, so think of going from right to left in the \cref{fig:expo} as we increase the iterations. In other words, as the iteration number, $i$, increases the flatter the graph between $\log L$ and $\log X$ becomes. This simply means that if we choose a large enough $k$, the tangent that we draw to approximate the gradient at point $i$ becomes less and less accurate for estimating the real gradient. Thus one sees that the red, purple and brown lines skew upwards. This is because the estimated gradient is smaller than it should be and thus the algorithm thinks that for a given $\log L$ increase, the $\log X$ decrease should have been less than it is. Again, this is due to the biased `estimated' gradient that is smaller than it should be in the direction of increasing iteration number (or decreasing $\log X$). So it adjusts the $\log X$ in a biased way, which is larger than the actual analytical value. This is why, in \cref{fig:logX1}, the increasing $k$ values result in more positive values for $(\log X -\log X_{\mathrm{Analytical}})$. To better understand this line of geometric reasoning one should carefully examine \cref{fig:expo} keeping in mind $\log X$ decreases as iteration number, $i$, increases.



The discussion in the paragraph above was useful to gain a sense of intuition as to how particular curvatures and gradients of the likelihood function may interfere with gradient nested sampling. However, the conclusion, which would be more generally applicable for all likelihoods, is that it does not matter how large the second derivative of the log-likelihood function is so long as $k$ is small enough relative to the number of live points.


The conclusion that we can draw from our preliminary results in \cref{fig:logX1} is that the $k$=10 value is seemingly the best trade-off between precision and accuracy. So let us start off by further analysing this before exploring other variations.


\begin{figure} 
\centering    
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Chapter2/Figs/Raster/chap2_fig3.pdf}
\caption{ A comparison of the $\log Z$ histogram plots as produced by the orthodox nested sampling algorithm and our newly proposed gradient nested sampling. The black vertical line represents the true analytical value of $\log Z$. The number of live points used throughout were $1000$.}
\label{fig:loll}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:loll} is a histogram plot of the log-evidences produced by gradient and orthodox nested sampling runs. We can see from \cref{fig:loll} that gradient nested sampling did not produce our expected result. The expected result was gradient nested sampling producing log-evidence histogram plots with the peak shifted closer to the true $\log Z$ value. Orthodox nested sampling produces an estimate of the evidence to within its error margins. Gradient nested sampling produces an apparently more accurate evidence value, but with an overconfident error bar which does not encompass the true value.

It does not seem that the issue would be fixed by the implementation of `dynamic nested sampling'~\cite{Higson_2018} but, since it has become an industry-standard, we still coded a dynamic gradient nested sampling version. Dynamic nested sampling is another version of nested sampling in which the number of live points is variable with each nested sampling iteration, instead of the live points being constant throughout the whole process.

We shall briefly go over the formulae used in the dynamic gradient nested sampling at this point. Note that the crucial difference in this definition will be the dependence of $N_i$ on the iteration number, as the number of live points now change for every nested sampling iteration. Examine a set of $k$ consecutive points in ${X_i}$ where the gradient,
\begin{equation}
g= \frac{d \log X}{d \log L},
\end{equation}
%
is approximately constant. Using the equations 
%
\begin{align}
g \delta \log L_{i} = \delta \log X_i= -\log t_i, \\
P(\log t_{i})=N_i e^{N_i \log t_i},
\end{align}
%
where $N_i$ is the number of `dynamic live points' at iteration number, $i$. We then find
%
\begin{align}
P(\delta \log L_i|g)= gN_ie^{N_i g \delta \log L_i},
\end{align}
%
where we substituted  $\log t_i= g\delta \log L_i$ and used 
%
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \log t_i}{d\delta \log L_i}= g.
\end{equation}
%
For a given set of data points $D= \{ \delta \log L_{i+1-(k/2)},\delta \log L_{i+2-(k/2)},...,\delta \log L_{i+(k/2)} \}$, which spans $k$ consecutive points chosen in a deliberately symmetrical fashion around $i$, we have
%
\begin{align}
P(D|g)&= \prod_{j=i+1-(k/2)}^{i+(k/2)} P(\delta \log L_j|g) = \prod_{j=i+1-(k/2)}^{i+(k/2)} gN_j\exp({N_jg \delta \log L_j}).\\
&\propto  g\exp\left( g \sum_{j=i+1-(k/2)}^{i+(k/2)} N_j \delta \log L_j\right).
\end{align}
%\left( \prod_{j=i+1-(k/2)}^{i+(k/2)}(gN_j)^k\right) 
Note that this time we vary the number of live points at each iteration and thus we could not take it out of the sum. Then we get that $\log t_i$ is follows a gamma distribution \cite{hogg_craig_1971} of the form:
%
\begin{equation}
P(\log t_i) \propto \frac{(\log t_i)^{k-1} }{\delta \log L_i}\exp \left( \log t_i \frac{\sum_{j=i+1-(k/2)}^{i+(k/2)} N_i \delta \log L_j}{\log L_i-\log L_{i-1}}\right).
\label{eq:uiui}
\end{equation}
%
Here, we used used Bayes' theorem with prior $\pi (g)=1/g$ to flip the conditional from $g$ to $D$. This step also used
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dg}{d\log t_i}  = 1/(\delta \log L_{i}),
\end{equation}
%
which is derived from \cref{eq:glogt} using that $\delta \log L_{i}$ is known and a constant. Utilising the result from \cref{eq:uiui}, we use a gamma distribution sampling function in the dynamic gradient nested sampling code to simulate $\log t_i$s. It is tested out as seen in \cref{fig:logL function}, where we plot the log-evidence values produced by dynamic orthodox and dynamic gradient nested sampling--that is, with variable number of live points. As we thought, it still does not do what we expect from gradient nested sampling.

We initiate each nested sampling run with $5000$ live points and incrementally go down to $100$, subtracting one live point at each subsequent iteration.}

The issue we are met with again is the determining of an ideal $k$ value. The $k$ value alone does not mean much. The same $k$ can produce vastly different results depending on the number of live points used during the run. From this point onward  we shall stick to non-dynamic nested sampling with $1000$ live points for every orthodox nested sampling and gradient nested sampling run. This is to reduce the number of variables within the hyperparameters of nested sampling algorithm itself. Especially since we did not find any utility in dynamic nested sampling regardless. In an effort towards the optimisation of the $k$ parameter we plot graphs in the next subsection with varying values of $k$, and we also compare these results to `analytical' gradient nested sampling. Where `analytical' gradient nested sampling is a version that uses the fact that our toy likelihood allows us to have an exact expression relating likelihood to prior volumes--which wouldn't be the case for cosmology applications. 


\subsection{Analytical Gradient Nested Sampling for Comparison in Context of Toy Problem}




\cref{fig:loglol} shows that varying the $k$ value is, essentially, not making any useful difference. One may think that \cref{fig:logX1} suggests otherwise but increasing $k$ only reduces the spread of the prior volumes and makes them converge towards the same mean value as the orthodox nested sampling prior volumes--rather than converging it towards the true prior volume value. How this translates to graph \cref{fig:loglol} is that increasing $k$ only reduces the size of the error bars rather than actually bringing the evidence closer to the real value. The ups and downs of the blue graph in \cref{fig:loglol} are a product of nothing but the usual nested sampling stochasticity. One can note from these results that increasing $k$ only reduces the spread. This may seem beneficial at first glance but it is not because the error bars should intersect with the true $\log Z$ value represented by the black horizontal line. The optimistic conclusion in this figure is that if we use the analytical gradient our idea of `gradient nested sampling' works exactly as envisioned (examine the red line). This supports that the method is perhaps theoretically sound, but we need to find a way to reduce the error on the estimated gradient. The log evidence in the `analytical gradient' red line shifts closer to the true value and also has a smaller spread--but not smaller to the extent that it does not intersect with the true value.


For completeness' sake must shortly go over how analytical gradient nested sampling is run. From the derivation in \cref{sec:level2}, we learn that we may use a function to draw values from a gamma distribution in our code to simulate our $\log t_i$s. Where the $\theta$ parameter in $\Gamma (k,\theta)$ is 
%
\begin{equation}
   \theta = \frac{(\log L_i-\log L_{i-1})}{(\log L_{i+k/2}-\log L_{i-k/2})}.
\label{eq:t1}
\end{equation}
%
Gradient nested sampling in its form introduced in the `Theory' section 2.1 does not produce the required results, so we use the analytical version of this expression in the plots in \cref{fig:loglol} to find avenues of improvement. The analytical version is:
%
\begin{equation}
   \theta = \frac{(\log L_i-\log L_{i-1})g_i}{k}.
\label{eq:t2}
\end{equation}
%
This equation has a $g_i$ term in it, this is the same term from \cref{eq:ggg}. In the toy example we use in this paper (refer to \cref{sec:exploring}), $g_i$ is just the analytical gradient at point $i$ given by:

\begin{equation}
    g_i = -\exp(\frac{-2 \log X_i}{C})C \sigma^2.
\label{eq:nest}
\end{equation}


Here, $\log X_i$ is also the true analytical $\log X$ value at point with $\log L_i$, as calculated by our analytical expression given in \cref{eq:toy}. The estimated version of it is 

\begin{equation}
   g_{\mathrm{estimate}}= \frac{k}{(\log L_{i+k/2}-\log L_{i-k/2})}.
\label{eq:est}
\end{equation}


This is the version of $g$ that we would usually use in non-toy example implementations of gradient nested sampling. This is because we would not generally have the luxury of knowing the analytical value as we do for the toy example. 


To make sure the decisions we made during our derivation were not detrimental we plot \cref{fig:loglolol}. We try the different priors that we mentioned in \cref{sec:exploring}. We also try utilising a set of consecutive points $D$ such that it is completely symmetrical around $i$ (denoted by the blue plot in \cref{fig:loglolol})--$D= \{ \delta \log L_{i+1-k},\delta \log L_{i+2-k},...,\delta \log L_{i+k} \}$. This has $K=2k+1$ for the gamma distribution generating the $\log t \sim \Gamma(K,\theta)$. We also try the same again but excluding the $i$th point in $D$ and thus excluding from our gradient estimation (denoted by grey plot). The idea was that if there is some anomaly in the increment taken by point $i$ from its previous step, then we do not want to take this anomalous point into consideration for our correction calculations. In other words, we cannot correct the anomaly in term $i$ by using the gradient information from the $i$ term itself. We thus remove the $\log L_i$ point from $D$. This has $K=2k$ for $\log t \sim \Gamma(K,\theta)$. However, we find that from our results plotted in \cref{fig:loglolol}, that seemingly none of these ideas hold any merit. Additionally, it was already evident that the prior was not at fault, since referring to \cref{fig:loglol}, we observed the ideal results using the original prior and analytical gradient (refer to the red plot).

The blue plot is a rolling average of the green plot over the $k/2$ terms ahead and $k/2$ terms behind the point being plotted. In other words, the blue plot is a rolling average of the gradient of the $k+1$ points in the vicinity of the point being plotted.}

\caption{ Plots which show the accuracy of gradient nested sampling over varying $k$ values. The $y$-axis represents the $\log Z$ values averaged over 100 different sets of $\log X$ simulations. That is, each point plotted is the average over 100 different nested sampling runs with the same set of $\log L$ samples but each with its own simulated $\log X$ set. The green line is the plot of the gradient nested sampling run utilising the estimated gradient expression (Eq. \ref{eq:est}) and the red is the plot of the gradient nested sampling run utilising the analytical gradient expression (Eq. \ref{eq:nest}). The blue line is a gradient nested sampling run which uses a rolling average of the gradient in place of the gradient in \cref{eq:est}. The rolling average is caried over the $3k$ terms ahead and $3k$ terms behind the point being plotted. For comparison, the $k$ value $=0$ point represents the results from the orthodox nested sampling algorithm.}

\label{fig:rrr}
\end{figure}

The results up until this point suggest that the main effort going ahead should be in finding better, more accurate estimators of the gradient $g$ (Eq. \ref{eq:est}). We plot $g$ as a function of $\log X$ in \cref{fig:fffff}. We see that the estimated gradient oscillated around the true gradient in a noisy, stochastic manner. The logical next step is to compute a rolling average of the estimated gradient and use it in place of the estimated gradient. We use these in the gradient nested sampling runs in \cref{fig:rrr}.





It seems that the rolling average of the gradient has finally reduced the noisiness enough to allow gradient nested sampling to work. This is quite an exciting result as it suggests we have a definite improvement to the precision and accuracy of nested sampling. We used a larger range of points in the rolling average for \cref{fig:rrr}, the rolling average was ran over $6k+1$ number of points. Of course, this number changes as $k$ changes. This rolling average range already becomes larger than the number of live points at $k=200$. We expect the gradient estimations to break down at the scale of the tangent being connected at points that are as far away as the number of live points, and this is exactly what we observe in our results. We increased the rolling average range because we noticed in \cref{fig:fffff} that $k+1$ points rolling averaged over is not enough to smooth out the noise. This starts to work extremely well around the $k=100$ mark, getting an almost perfect result at $k=150$ and then of course getting extremely biased again as $k$ reaches close to the number of live points. We previously established that this is roughly the order of $k$ at which gradient nested sampling starts to break down. 


\section{Conclusion}

Given the centrality of model comparison in science, and the fact that nested sampling represents the state of the art in numerically computing Bayesâ factors, any fundamental improvements in nested sampling accuracy would be deemed monumental. Our results show promise in this regard but they are still preliminary. Further work and scrutiny must be carried out in relation to gradient nested sampling. We concede that the rolling average method is a primitive way of getting gradient nested sampling to work. A more sophisticated way to get it to work is likely to exist. Skilling himself believed that a `prior on curves' must exist but we just need to find it~\cite{10.1214/06-BA127,paris2022}. Perhaps one could use Gaussian processes to more accurately estimate and reduce the errors on the gradient (Eq. \ref{eq:est}) and accordingly incorporate the error information into the estimates of the prior volume~\cite{paris2022}. This would be a more robust and rigorous way to get gradient nested sampling to work and even further improve upon the already exciting results. Another way to reduce the noise in the gradient estimators is to increase the ratio $N/k$. We will look into this parameter along with our future work on Gaussian processes.
